# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges provide an excellent opportunity to enhance coding skills by working on realistic projects.

## Overview

The challenge involved building a FAQ accordion that allows users to hide/show the answer to a question when clicked. Additionally, users should be able to navigate questions and toggle answers using keyboard navigation alone. The goal was to achieve a responsive design suitable for various screen sizes and implement hover and focus states for interactive elements.
